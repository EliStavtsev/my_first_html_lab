        <p>I love roblox. Roblox is my favorite game. Why you might ask?,well i love playing it because it is an online game where you can play user generated games.,And another one of my favorite features is the way that you can customize your avatar with cool roblox or user generated items you can talk to people in a filtered chat so no foul language is used you can add friends and report people if they are acting suspicious or talking weird. which is what makes roblox a safe community there is also a platform wher you can create games for people to enjoy the website is (roblox.com/create) yoiu can creatye items to upload on roblox by using (blender.org) my personal favorite game is Jailbreak on roblox i love it because its about cops and criminals,the criminals have to rob stores like, the jewlery store,bank,power plant,cargo plane,cargo train,cargo boat and way more.The criminals gain bounty by robbing stores and the police have to arrest them for their bounty.There are also missions you need to do the missions to gain XP(experience) and you can use XP to level up,when you level up you can get prizes such as vehicle skins,money,and acessories for your car. One of my favorite things about jailbreak is an update that was recently added: They added dogs to jailbreak,a german shepherd(for the police team) And a bulldog (for the criminal team)as you may see i have alot of reasons why i like this game i think you should try playing sometime!
