        <p  style=color: 0, 255, 204, >I love roblox. Roblox is my favorite game. Why you might ask?,well i love playing it because it is an online game where you can play user generated games.,And another one 
            of my favorite features is the way that you can customize your avatar with cool roblox or user generated items you can talk to people in a filtered chat so no foul language is used you can add 
            friends and report people if they are acting suspicious or talking weird. which is what makes roblox a safe community there is also a platform wher you can create games for people to enjoy the 
            website is (roblox.com/create) yoiu can creatye items to upload on roblox by using (blender.org) my personal favorite game is Jailbreak on roblox i love it because its about cops and criminals,
            he criminals have to rob stores like, the jewlery store,bank,power plant,cargo plane,cargo train,cargo boat and way more.The criminals gain bounty by robbing stores and the police have to arrest 
            them for their bounty.There are also missions you need to do the missions to gain XP(experience) and you can use XP to level up,when you level up you can get prizes such as vehicle skins,money,
            and acessories for your car. One of my favorite things about jailbreak is an update that was recently added: They added dogs to jailbreak,a german shepherd(for the police team) And a bulldog (for 
            the criminal team)as you may see i have alot of reasons why i like this game i think you should try playing sometime!

                                                                        if you know what robux is it is the in-game currency but back then over 7 years ago there were these things called tix (tickets)  which was what they used to purchase hats and avatar clothing back then!
                                                                        The roblox corporation has come a very long way in 12 years it is a very old game but a very good one!</p>
